# The Shu Personal Blog

Built by github pages. Some thought, some life, and maybe, some philosophy. Gender theory / community empowerment. 

## Usage

Requirement: [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).

These instructions are for me myself, I will do these (since 2022-05-20):
1. Modify the articles and configurations (all but the `docs` directory). With daemon `hugo server` doing harmless test by running a mini server on `localhost`. 
2. Make commits for them if satisfied.
3. Run `hugo` to build the site. This will generate static html  files in the `docs` directory. 
4. Make commits for those builds, and push. 

## Structure

To backup all the articles written by me and my friends in this blog, just download all files in the `content` directory.
